Viết personal essays là một cơ hội để bạn reflect lại những giá trị mình trân trọng, tìm hiểu chính mình.
Ở bài [Bí quá thì làm gì](../../question-yourself), bọn mình đã gợi ý cho bạn những câu hỏi bạn có thể hỏi chính mình để bắt đầu xây dựng ý tưởng cho bài viết.
Trong bài này, mình có thể dùng ChatGPT để hỏi những câu hỏi chi tiết hơn và liên quan trực tiếp đến đề bài được đưa ra.
Sau đây là ví dụ một input mình đưa vào ChatGPT.

### First round

> In a minute, I will ask you to help me generate some ideas for my personal statement as part of my application to the University of Washington.
> The prompt is:   
> "Our families and communities often define us and our individual worlds. The community might refer to your cultural group, extended family, religious group, neighborhood or school, sports team or club, co-workers, etc. Describe the world you come from and how you, as a product of it, might add to the diversity of the University of Washington."
>
> Before we begin, I want you to fully understand me as an individual.
> Ask me at least 20 questions about my life, background, education, hobbies, and anything else you need in order to complete the tasks to the best of your ability.

### Second round

Nếu bạn đã đọc [bài đầu tiên](../01-tips) trong series GPT thì bạn sẽ nhớ là vòng đầu tiên thường sẽ không cho bạn một kết quả tốt.
Trong trường hợp này, GPT chắc sẽ hỏi những câu hỏi rất chung chung.
Bạn có thể nudge GPT theo một hướng mình muốn, ví dụ:

> Make these questions deeper and more specific.

Sau đây là những câu hỏi mà ChatGPT đưa ra.
Có thể bạn sẽ không trả lời được hết tất cả những câu hỏi này, có thể bạn sẽ muốn trả lời thêm.
Mình khuyên là các bạn cố gắng để dành thời gian ra suy nghĩ, thậm chí còn hỏi ba mẹ, bạn bè nếu cần thiết.
Dù gì thì đây cũng là một quá trình tìm hiểu chính bản thân mình mà.
